# 💡 Experiment 3: Bitwise Operators in C++

## 🎯 Aim
To study and implement **bitwise operators** in C++.

---

## 📚 Theory

Bitwise operators perform operations on the **binary representations** of integers. These are useful for low-level programming, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications.

### 👉 Bitwise Operators:
| Operator | Description        | Example     |
|----------|--------------------|-------------|
| `&`      | AND                | `a & b`     |
| `|`      | OR                 | `a | b`     |
| `^`      | XOR                | `a ^ b`     |
| `~`      | One’s complement   | `~a`        |
| `<<`     | Left shift         | `a << 1`    |
| `>>`     | Right shift        | `a >> 1`    |

> These operations are performed **bit by bit**.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Understanding binary equivalents of integers
- Performing AND, OR, XOR, NOT operations
- Using bit shifts to multiply/divide by powers of 2

---

## 🧪 Procedure
1. Start your C++ program with:
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;
   ```
2. Declare integer variables and assign values.
3. Apply bitwise operators and display the result.
4. Run the code and observe the output.

---

## ⚠️ Note
- C++ does not have a built-in way to **display binary**, so results will be in decimal form unless additional logic is used.

---

## ✅ Sample Output
Performs and shows results of:
- `a & b`
- `a | b`
- `a ^ b`
- `~a`
- `a << 1`
- `a >> 1`

---

## 🎓 Experiment Summary
- Understood how bitwise operators manipulate data at the binary level
- Explored how shifting bits can simulate multiplication/division
- Learned how to use low-level operations for performance or hardware programming
