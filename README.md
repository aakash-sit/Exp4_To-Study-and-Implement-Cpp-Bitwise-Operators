# 🧪 Experiment 4 - Decision Making in C++

## 🎯 Aim
To study and implement decision-making statements in C++, including:
- `if` and `else` statements
- `else-if` ladder
- Nested `if` statements

---

## 🧠 Theory

In programming, decision-making is essential for controlling the flow of execution. C++ provides structured ways to make decisions based on conditions using conditional statements.

### 1️⃣ if Statement
Executes a block of code only when a given condition is true.

**Syntax:**
```cpp
if (condition) {
    // code to execute
}
```

### 2️⃣ if-else Statement
Provides two different paths based on a true or false condition.

**Syntax:**
```cpp
if (condition) {
    // code if true
} else {
    // code if false
}
```

### 3️⃣ else-if Ladder
Used to check multiple conditions one after another.

**Syntax:**
```cpp
if (condition1) {
    // block 1
} else if (condition2) {
    // block 2
} else {
    // default block
}
```

### 4️⃣ Nested if Statement
Allows checking inner conditions when an outer condition is true.

**Syntax:**
```cpp
if (condition1) {
    if (condition2) {
        // code if both conditions are true
    }
}
```

## ⚙️ Procedure

1. Create a new C++ file using your IDE.
2. Include the necessary header (`#include <iostream>`) and use the `main()` function.
3. Declare required variables.
4. Use different conditional statements:
   - Check if a number is positive or negative
   - Compare values using relational operators
   - Categorize marks or input ranges
5. Print the output using `cout`.
6. Compile and run the program for different test inputs.

## 🔍 Learning Outcomes

- Understood how conditions control execution flow in C++
- Applied decision-making logic using `if`, `else`, and nested structures
- Learned to combine logical and relational operators in conditions
- Practiced writing structured and readable code

---

## 📌 Key Concepts Covered

- Conditional structures in C++
- Relational operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- Logical operators: `&&`, `||`, `!`
- Nested decision logic

## 📝 Experiment Summary

In this experiment, we explored how C++ enables decision-making in programs. By using `if`, `if-else`, `else-if`, and nested conditions, we controlled the program's behavior based on inputs. This forms the foundation for writing interactive and responsive code in real-world applications.
